# Usage

This project was written using Python 3 and can be ran with Jupyter Notebook.

The program will download the data (approx. 2gb) and split it into additional smaller files for manageable use. It uses roughly 1/10th of the data to avoid long waits but this can be changed by changing file names in the code.

Simply download the .ipynb file and run in Juypter.
